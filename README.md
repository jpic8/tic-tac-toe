# tic-tac-toe

This Tic Tac Toe assignment for The Odin Project was another difficult one. I wasn't even sure where to begin for the long time, and as usual I basically skipped right over CSS and went straight into Javascript. This was a mess because I should have set up the visual representation of my board before trying to mess around with the backend game logic.

I was without direction and struggling where to start, and upon searching the internet and finding out there's about a million different ways to do this project, I settled for another video tutorial by Web Dev Simplified - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM

So while this project is none of my original code, I did learn quite a bit throughout this tutorial Most importantly, how powerful CSS can actually be with regard to visual representation, which is something not really taught in the Javascript section of The Odin Project. Additionally, I was very impressed with the usage of boolean values, even player turns.

I may return at a later date change the styling slightly before posting a GH pages link.
